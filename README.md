## Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data ##
This repository contains 4 documents:

1. `README.md`
    the markdown file you are currently reading;
2. `UCI HAR Tidy Dataset.txt`
    an output .txt file with a tidy set of data summarised from the folder;
    `UCI HAR Dataset`
3. `CodeBook.md`
    the other markdown file clarifying the column names and types of data 
    included in `UCI HAR Tidy Dataset.txt`;
4. `run_analysis.R`
    the R script that would produce the same results in `UCI HAR Tidy Dataset.txt`.

In particular, `CodeBook.md` contains details of getting and cleaning the 
training and test sets under `UCI HAR Dataset`. The `run_analysis.R` is also 
annotated to help with understanding the steps taken to clean the data.
