## Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data ##

This repository contains 4 documents:

1. `README.md`
    the markdown file you are currently reading;
    
2. `UCI HAR Tidy Dataset.txt`
    an output .txt file with a summarised tidy set of data;
    
3. `CodeBook.md`
    another markdown file clarifying the column names and types of data included 
    in `UCI HAR Tidy Dataset.txt`;
    
4. `run_analysis.R`
    R script that would produce the same results in `UCI HAR Tidy Dataset.txt`.

In particular, `CodeBook.md` contains details of getting and cleaning the 
training and test sets under `UCI HAR Dataset`. The `run_analysis.R` is also 
annotated to help with understanding the steps taken to clean the data.
